Title -- Weather APP.
<br/>
This is my 1st Reactjs project.
<br/>
Skills used - reactjs,Api.
<br/>
Concepts learned during development -- useState,useEffect,useContext,props. 
<br/>
And also learned how to host ReactJs in github.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

By creating this web page ,I was able to learn how to maintain state using useState and also how to use useEffect.
By using Api fetching Datas are dynamically injected.
